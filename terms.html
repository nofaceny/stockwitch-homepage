            <p><strong>None of this constitutes personalized investment advice.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>No Warranties on Accuracy</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>Investment Risks</h3>
        <p>Investing in stocks carries significant risk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may lose some or all of your investment</li>
            <li>Past performance does not guarantee future results</li>
            <li>Market conditions can change rapidly</li>
            <li>No prediction or signal is guaranteed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You are solely responsible for your investment decisions and their outcomes.</strong></p>

        <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
        <p>Abonglab is not registered as an investment advisor with the SEC, a broker-dealer, a commodity trading advisor, or a financial planner. We provide information only. For personalized advice, consult a licensed financial professional.</p>

        <h3>No Market Manipulation</h3>
        <p>Users must not use the App to coordinate pump-and-dump schemes, spread false information to move stock prices, engage in wash trading, or violate securities laws. Such activities are illegal and will result in immediate account termination and reporting to authorities.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
        <p>The App may provide links to open stocks in brokerage apps (Robinhood, Webull, etc.). These are convenience features only. We do not receive compensation from these brokerages, are not responsible for their services, and do not endorse any particular brokerage.</p>

        <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>Abonglab uses artificial intelligence (including Google's Gemini models) to summarize news articles, generate market signals, analyze stock sentiment, and provide insights.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of AI</h3>
        <p>AI-generated content may contain factual errors, can be biased based on training data, should not be relied upon as sole source of information, and is not a substitute for human judgment or professional advice.</p>
        <p><strong>Always verify AI-generated information with multiple sources before making decisions.</strong></p>
